# Deep review — six agents, one subsystem each (2026-08-01)

Six adversarial agents, each scoped to one subsystem so they went deep rather than
wide. Every finding below carries `file:line` and how it was established
(**reproduced** = the agent ran a test that showed it; **traced** = read and
reasoned). Verify against the repo before acting — line numbers drift.

Closed items keep their commit hash so they are not re-reported.

**The pattern worth reading first:** three agents independently found the same
shape — **blind writes living in a system whose safety comes from status-checked
transactions**. `markCompleted` had it (fixed `e94cb79`); `markHeld`,
`setJobSlotHeld` and `refundForJob` did not. That is a missing rule, not three
bugs.

---

## G · Report integrity

- ~~**G1 — The degrade loop overwrites sections that were successfully written.**~~ **Closed `7b7532e`.**
  `research-engine.ts:535-544`. **Reproduced, both directions.** The loop degrades
  `produces` *and* `enriches` for every agent not in `done`, with no check that the
  section already holds real content. If a refiner fails, the producer's delivered
  section is replaced by a placeholder; if a producer fails, the refiner's real
  output is overwritten. Florida has four enrich edges. The existing degrade test
  runs in `essential`, which excludes every refiner — which is why it never saw it.
- ~~**G2 — Degraded placeholders fabricate readable data.**~~ **Closed `7b7532e`.** `research-engine.ts:851-896`
  (`emptyFromJsonSchema`). **Reproduced.** The buyer-facing note lands only in the
  first string field; enums get `enum[0]`, numbers `0`, `.min(N)` arrays get N rows
  of zeros. A degraded verdict section rendered literally
  `{"recommendation": "buy", "price": 0}`. To a buyer of investment research that
  is a fabricated buy recommendation.
- **G3 — `degradedSections` is documented as agent ids; it holds section keys.**
  `research-engine.ts:72-73`. Doc only.

## H · The job state machine

- ~~**H1 — `markHeld` is a blind write.**~~ **Closed `63c1626`.** `jobs/firestore.ts:197`. **Reproduced.**
  Park a live job → resolve with refund → a straggler run hits a hold path →
  `markHeld` flips `failed` back to `held`, overwriting the `hold` that recorded the
  resolution. `approve` then accepts it (it assumes held ⇒ never refunded),
  re-dispatches, and the report is delivered with the refund kept.
- ~~**H2 — `setJobSlotHeld` is a blind write.**~~ **Closed `63c1626`.** `slots.ts:115-117`. **Reproduced.** A
  straggler completing between `claimJobSlot(force)` and the flag leaves a
  `completed` job with `slotHeld: true` and `inFlight: 1` forever. With the cap at
  1 that is a permanent, product-wide lockout, and no admin endpoint touches the
  slots collection.
- **H3 — The worker acks jobs `runJob` never recorded an outcome for.**
  `run-job.ts:51-63` + `worker/src/index.ts:92-95`. **Reproduced.** `getTemplate`,
  `getJob`, `markRunning` and `setJobAttempts` run *before* the try whose catch
  parks the job. A throw there returns 200, the queue never returns, and the job is
  stranded with its slot held.
- **H4 — Unguarded Firestore writes inside engine callbacks.** `run-job.ts:143`
  (`setJobCost` in `onTrace`), `:136-139` (`setProgress` in `onProgress`). **Traced.**
  One failed write parks a healthy job as `held`, or fails the attempt with
  `stalled` — which by the reuse rule forces the retry to re-buy the whole research
  loop.
- **H5 — Stats booked and checkpoint deleted before `markCompleted` can refuse.**
  `run-job.ts:298-322`. **Traced.** A refused delivery still books a completed
  report, and the checkpoint is gone so the work cannot be resurrected.
- **H6 — No cross-process lease on a dispatch.** `run-job.ts:61`. **Traced.**
  Duplicate delivery while a dispatch runs passes the status check (`running` is not
  skipped, by design for resume) and two engines resume from one checkpoint.

## I · Money

The subsystem is sound — every mutation is a transaction writing ledger and balance
together, and `store.ts` is the only writer. What is left is who is trusted.

- ~~**I1 — `refundForJob` does not read the job's status.**~~ **Closed `63c1626`.** `credits/store.ts:157-176`.
  **Reproduced at store level.** `resolve` flips to `failed`; an admin `retry` lands
  in the window between the two awaits and re-queues it; `resolve`'s refund then
  commits anyway. End state: `queued` **and** refunded — a free report.
- ~~**I2 — `refundForJob` credits the caller's `(appId, userId)`,**~~ **Closed `63c1626`.** while the amount
  comes from the consume entry. `store.ts:153-176`. **Reproduced.** Unreachable via
  the API today; the transaction already reads the entry that holds the right pair.
- **I3 — Partial failure between `consumeCredits` and `createJob`.**
  `apps/api/src/index.ts:1020-1030`. **Traced.** Charged, no job document, and no
  admin endpoint can refund it — `resolve` needs a held job. Same class: a crash
  between `rejectHold` and `refundForJob` loses the refund the admin chose.
- **I4 — The store accepts non-positive amounts.** `store.ts:81-85`. **Reproduced**
  (`consume(-5)` raises the balance). Unreachable today; convention-only.
- **I5 — Grant idempotency keys share one global namespace.** `store.ts:115`.
  Same key for two users silently no-ops the second.
- **I6 — Stripe: credits minted on `checkout.session.completed` without checking
  `payment_status`,** and no clawback on refunds or disputes.
  `apps/api/src/index.ts:1718-1743`. Config-dependent; policy gap.

## J · Tenancy and exposure

- ~~**J1 — Any buyer can download our internals.**~~ **Closed `a992e0d`.** `index.ts:1333-1338`, `:1441`.
  **Reproduced.** `/research/:jobId` carefully redacts `cost`, `hold` and warnings
  for non-admins, then hands the same caller the `files[]` list. `trace.json` holds
  per-agent USD, resolved model aliases, the internal search/retry log, **stack
  traces**, and the prompt `brief`; `metadata.json` and `report.json` hold the cost
  block. It works with a `report-read` token too — the one the docs describe as
  unable to read anything else.
- **J2 — Account pre-hijack survives.** `index.ts:437`. **Reproduced.** Register the
  victim's address with the attacker's password; the victim clicks a genuine
  "verify your email"; the attacker signs in. Reaches admin only if the admin app is
  given `emailFrom`/`webUrl`.
- **J3 — No session revocation of any kind.** `auth.ts:103-108`. **Reproduced.**
  `requireAdmin` trusts the token's `role` claim; removing someone from
  `adminEmails` — the only de-admin control — does nothing for up to 7 days. A
  password reset does not evict an intruder either. (Deactivating the *app* does
  work, so the per-request plumbing exists.)
- **J4 — Emailed verify/reset links are unlimited-use for their whole TTL.**
  `index.ts:423-447`, `:517-539`. **Reproduced** — same reset token replayed returns
  a fresh 7-day session each time.
- **J5 — `${appId}__${userId}` keys are ambiguous** and the appId pattern permits
  `_`. `credits/store.ts:29`, `index.ts:1855`. **Reproduced.** One character in the
  pattern closes it.
- **J6 — No `setErrorHandler`,** so Fastify's default returns `err.message` on a 500.

## K · Request guards — both directions

**Too strict** (each **reproduced**; a hard 422 for an ordinary customer):

- ~~**K1 — `in jailbreak` fires on ordinary prose,**~~ **Closed `PENDING`.** across sentence *and* array
  boundaries. `moderation/moderate.ts:93` via `tolerantPattern`. "escape rooms in
  Orlando that specialise in jailbreak and heist themes" is rejected — an escape
  room is a plausible acquisition target for this product.
- ~~**K2 — The attribution whitelist is 17 closed tokens.**~~ **Closed `PENDING`.** `moderate.ts:79`.
  13 legitimate strings blocked across en/es/fr/pt; French `de\b` does not cover
  `des`. "instructions from the broker" passes, "instructions provided by the
  listing agent" does not.
- ~~**K3 — One article defeats the price lookahead.**~~ **Closed `PENDING`.** `moderate.ts:85`. "Forget
  everything above **the** $1M asking price" is rejected; the corpus entry without
  the article passes.
- ~~**K4 — "the system prompt/instructions" in equipment prose.**~~ **Closed `PENDING`.** `moderate.ts:86,90`.
  Alarm, POS and security businesses are described exactly this way.

**Too permissive:**

- ~~**K5 — Soft hyphen and Unicode tag characters walk past the pre-screen.**~~ **Closed `PENDING`.**
  `util/text.ts:23`. **Reproduced.** One line: add `­` and
  `\u{E0000}-\u{E007F}` to `INVISIBLE`.
- **K6 — `/research/preflight` has no request meter at all.**
  `index.ts:1085-1210`. **Reproduced** — 60 consecutive calls, all 200, ~5 Firestore
  ops each. Every sibling route carries a meter *in addition* to the captcha.
- **K7 — The burst guard runs after the outbound captcha verify.**
  `captcha.ts:85-92` vs `public-limit.ts:106`. **Reproduced** — 80 registrations
  with a junk token produced 80 outbound Cloudflare calls, each holding a 5s timeout.
- **K8 — An appended payload survives `acceptCorrections` on a long field.**
  `enrich.ts:59`. **Reproduced.** The existing test uses an 11-character field, so
  what rejects the attack there is the length bound at its tightest — not the
  similarity logic it claims to test.

## L · The test suite

Closed in `d20c99b`: the suites were never typechecked; each package now has a
`tsconfig.test.json`. That commit also fixed a test that asserted less than it
claimed (`verifyCaptcha('   ' && '')`, which hid a real defect) and one of mine that
could not catch its own revert.

Still open — **13 tests proven unable to fail** (each verified by editing source and
watching it stay green):

| test | why it cannot fail |
|---|---|
| `worker/test/run.test.ts:16-19,26` | `notify` is never asserted; the fixture omits `emailFrom` so it returns early |
| `fbizlab/test/job-view.test.tsx:60` | `useJob` is mocked wholesale; the predicate it names is unreachable |
| `fbizlab/test/new-report.test.tsx:153` | asserts the preflight payload; `createJob` is mocked and never asserted |
| `moderation.test.ts:220`, `:216` | the length bound rejects first; the branch under test never runs |
| `auth-tokens.test.ts:21` | the fixture's signature is literally `bad`, so it fails on shape, not key |
| `public-limits.test.ts:153` | test env sets burst to 500; 41 requests never approach it |
| `auth.test.ts:181` | no credential seeded, so nothing was going to be mailed |
| `admin.test.ts:178` | Fastify's `removeAdditional` strips the field first |
| `budget-ceiling.test.ts:173-178` | the setup returns via the held branch, so the subject strings are empty |
| `budget-refund.test.ts:239` | out-of-band call; no production path pairs those two |
| `assist-allowance.test.ts:94` | the setup never earns a cooldown, so clearing it is untested |
| `engine.test.ts:55` | re-parses already-parsed data |

**One test encodes a bug as the contract:** `security.test.ts:132` — the comment
says unknown languages fall back to English, the assertion pins 400, and the
manifest documents fallback. One of the two has to move.

**Highest-value missing tests** (each names the one-line source change that would
make it fail — a recommendation without that is not real):

1. `markCompleted` returns false on a resolved job — all 8 current uses are fixtures
   and none check the return.
2. `/admin/jobs/:jobId/read-token` is admin-only — zero test hits, and it mints a
   15-minute token for *any* jobId.
3. `/research` ignores `?userId=` for non-admins — the identical pattern on
   `/credits/balance` is tested; this sibling is not.
4. `listJobs` filters by user, not just app — today's anti-spoof test uses two
   different apps, so deleting the `userId` filter survives it.
5. Every `/research/:jobId*` route refuses a foreign token — the five-line ownership
   guard is copy-pasted into four handlers and only one has a test. **Any of the
   other three lines can be deleted today and all tests stay green.**
6. `requeueJob`'s in-transaction refund precondition — `requeueJob` and
   `wasJobRefunded` appear in zero test files.
7. `releaseUnclaimedSlot` floors at zero — zero references; a negative counter
   uncaps concurrent spend.
8. Grant idempotency keys are per-user (fails today — I5).
